## Given
**Mass of Earth**: 5.972x10^24 kg  
**Distance Between Earth and Sun**: 1.496x10^11 m  
**Gravitational acceleration of Earth**: 9.8

## Here's how you can do it

1.  **Gravitational Force between Earth and Sun**: According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force (FF) between two objects with masses m1m1​ and m2m2​ separated by a distance rr is given by: F=G⋅m1⋅m2r2F=r2G⋅m1​⋅m2​​ where GG is the gravitational constant.
    
2.  **Gravitational Force on Earth Due to the Sun**: The gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the Earth is equal to the force that keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. This force is given by: F=mEarth⋅gEarthF=mEarth​⋅gEarth​
    
3.  **Equating the Forces**: Since the gravitational force on Earth due to the Sun is equal to the force calculated using Newton's law of gravitation, we can equate the two expressions: mEarth⋅gEarth=G⋅mSun⋅mEarthr2mEarth​⋅gEarth​=r2G⋅mSun​⋅mEarth​​
    
4.  **Solving for the Mass of the Sun (m_sun)**: We can solve for the mass of the Sun (mSunmSun​) using the given values: mSun=gEarth⋅r2GmSun​=GgEarth​⋅r2​
