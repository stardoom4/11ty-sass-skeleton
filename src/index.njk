<p><strong>Shinji Ikari</strong>: Ayanami! Are you all right? Ayanami! â€¦Donâ€™t ever say that! Just donâ€™t say that you have nothing else! Just donâ€™t say that! And donâ€™t say goodbye when you leave for a mission, itâ€™s just too sad. [sobs quietly]<br>
    <strong>Rei Ayanami </strong>: Why are you crying? Iâ€™m very sorry I donâ€™t know what I should do or feel at a time like this.<br>
    <strong>Shinji Ikari</strong>: Why donâ€™t you just try smiling?
    [Rei smiles]</p>
